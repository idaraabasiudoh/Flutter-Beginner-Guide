## About the App

This Flutter-based quiz application allows users to answer a series of questions and receive a final score based on their responses. Each question presents multiple answer choices, and the app dynamically calculates a score depending on the selected answers. At the end of the quiz, users can see their total score and a result message that categorizes their performance. Additionally, the app provides an option to restart the quiz for a fresh attempt, making it a simple yet effective way to practice building interactive UIs with Flutter.
